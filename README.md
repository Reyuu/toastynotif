## Overview
Toasty is an addon for Ashita v4, which displays toast notifications every time you pick up an item!

> [!NOTE]
> The addon works by checking for specific a chat message, while this isn't fully efficient, it mimics vanilla behaviour - you know you got the item by checking chat anyways.

## Installation
1. Paste the addon into your addon folder in Ashita v4 installation.
2. Activate the addon with `/addon load toastynotif`
3. (optionally) Add `/addon load toastynotif` to configuration `scripts/default.txt` script

## Uninstallation
1. Simply delete the folder from your addon folder in Ashita v4 installation.
2. (optionally) If you added toasty to your configuration script, delete it from the file as well.

## Configuration
You can see available commands through `/toastynotif help`.

Settings window can be accessed through `/toastynotif settings`.

You can test your settings via `/toastynotif test`.
